Summary : 

1. The CaesarCipher program first describes what it does.
2. It prompts the user, asking whether the user wants to encode or decode a message.
3. If the user does not respond with either encode or decode, the program displays the valid options to the user (as shown above) and then exits.
4. Otherwise, the program prompts the user for the string to either encode or decode.
5. Finally, rather than shifting according to a user-defined value, the program displays all 26 possible ways of encoding or decoding that string.

VigenereCipher

Summary :

The Vigenère Cipher is a substitution cipher like the Caesar Cipher. However, unlike the Caesar Cipher that has a fixed key, the Vigenère Cipher uses a keyword to shift the plain text. If the length of a keyword is shorter than the plain text, it replicates itself until it matches the length of the plain text.
